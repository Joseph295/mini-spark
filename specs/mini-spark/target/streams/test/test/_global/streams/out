[debug] Running TaskDef(mini.spark.RDDSuite, org.scalatest.tools.Framework$$anon$1@14a722ef, false, [SuiteSelector])
[info] RDDSuite:
[info] - map/filter/flatMap correctness
[info] - lazy evaluation triggers only on action
[info] - take triggers shuffle job for reduceByKey RDDs
[info] - cache hit avoids recompute
[info] - spill to disk when memory is insufficient
[info] - task retry succeeds after failure
[info] - cache retry does not commit failed attempt
[info] - shuffle idempotent output with retry
[info] - explicit cleanup removes shuffle and disk cache
[info] - parallelize respects numSlices, including non-positive
[info] - reduceByKey correctness with random input
[info] - stage splitting produces map stage + result stage
[info] - shuffle cleanup happens after job
[info] Run completed in 183 milliseconds.
